1,"The product is as it says. I keep an eye on it to make sure it doesnt go off without reason though, it would be quite uncomfortable for the pups, but it is sometimes needed in neighborhoods.",dogs
2,My Kitty thinks these are treats! He loves them. He seams to have more energy and doesn't get sick as often. The only downside is it makes his output really really stinky.,dogs
3,"This is the third or fourth time that we've ordered the big 20lb box of these because:- we have 2 old Australian Shepherds (15 and 16 at this point) who have been active their entire lives and keeping their joints in good shape is central to their happiness, they are not the kind of dogs content to stay inside and immobile all day- they're picky (especially the younger of the two, Abby) and we have not been able to find any other joint treats or tablets that she would not either spit out or refuse to even put in her mouth- they LOVE these treats, we joke that they're like 'crack' to Abby because she gets all jazzed and wide-eyed when she sees us going for them, and she's not the begging type!- they have a good crunch but aren't too hard for our aging dogs teeth or jaws to handle comfortably-- they're also not too hard to break up into several smaller pieces for when we go on walks",dogs
4,Put this on both my dogs. And they are scratching 2 weeks later. And still have fleas. Do not buy this product.,dogs
5,My cats do not like this toy. I've had it for a few weeks and never see them playing with it. I would not recommend it.,cats
6,"This works really well. Just be careful to not stay in one place for too long as it will hurt your pet. It is made solidly and works much better than similar products out there. Highly recommended, I use it every night.",cats

9,"I'm not happy with the way it was shipped. It was shipped the least expensive way by the company. It went to the address I requested. Since I don't live there, my ex husband told the letter carrier where I resided. It went back to a post office close to me. Then I had to pay more to pick it up. Any way I can keep this from happening again?",cats
10,"I actually purchased my kennel from a different seller. I got a great deal as local costs for kennels were $280+.After receiving it, I pulled the directions out and followed them step by step. The directions were easy to follow. I was able to get the frame together in about 10-15 minutes.The chain link come folded so you have to open it up length wise, straighten the links, and then roll it back up to place on the frame. There were kinks in it and some of the fence was narled pretty badly. I just did my best to straighten them out. After about 45 minutes to an hour later, I finally had it installed on the frame.I put my dog in it. She appeared to be annoyed that she was in it. Later that evening I came outside to put some items in the shed. My dog walked by me. I thought it was a bit odd so I escorted her back to the kennel. The kennel was moved at an angle. I thought she had dug under it. After closer inspection, I found the bottom half of the fence gnarled up. The fence has very little dried blood on it. I checked my dog for injuries but did not see anything.I went back to the directions and made sure I had set the wire ties at the appropriate spacing for the fence to be attached to the frame, which was correct. I had to pickup some wire ties at the local hardware store. $4.00 per 30 ties. I bent the fence back into place and re-tied the fence adding a few more ties to each side then put my dog back in the kennel. After another hour or so I came back to check on her. She got out again on the opposite side. After about three days of going back and fouth addind more and more ties and straighten the fence out. I finally managed to get her to stay in the kennel. I had to add a tie at every ending link and I ended up having to add a hanger in the middle of the links on the area she continued to come out at.It's a good deal, but you have to do a little extra to make it last. I did end up getting the cover, and it fits rather funny and doesn't sit all that well.",dogs

14,my wife has tried a dozen different type of poop bags and these are the best. They are the thickest plastic and easiest to open. and the price is hard to beat for so many rolls,dogs
15,"Dogs love these treats and they come in a large box so I just take out what I need and store it in a plastic container in the kitchen. Very economical, compared to the treats you buy in the supermarket, and they are good and healthy for the dogs, too. Would definitely recommend them.",dogs
16,"Before I got this I was going through two plastic bags a day cleaning after my cat, this from someone who always brings her own canvas bag to the grocery to avoid waste! Plus my trash would smell, etc etc. Now I keep the litter locker right next to the box and the process of scooping it takes one minute and no residual smell!

20,Very cute toy...but we have a 60lb. 9 month old puppy who ate the tongue and tail with great relish....so guess this is best suited for an older dog or one who is not so into chewing!!!,dogs
21,This is a really great product. The one thing that would make it better would be either a dome top or higher walls for containing the litter. Make sure you read the other reviews about the type of litter to buy---it's important. This didn't work out for me because,cats
22,My dog would routinely destroy tennis type balls in just a couple hours.This has been around for weeks now and is still in good shape. It's light enough for him to catch without damaging his mouth yet tough enough to stand up to his chewing. He much prefers it to his Kong ball which is too hard for him to catch safely.,dogs
23,"The only advantage to this product is that it is lightweight and easy to carry home from the grocery store. I have been using the traditional Fresh Step Scoopable for years, and have found it superior to all other products for keeping down odor. I was hoping the Natural product would provide the same functionality without the heavy weight and without the environmental impact. Unfortunately, this is not the case.",cats
24,"I really like this product, bought the first one at a pet store for my husky and wanted another one for my malinois, but the pet stores no longer carried it. Was able to get this from amazon, glad I was albe to. This is a very sturdy product and is very stable and hard for the dog to drag around unlike what the pet stores had available.",cats
25,"I purchased this because of the description saying it was INVINCIBLE and ""JW's patented molding process links each ring together with no seams and no glue to produce a strong long lasting toy."" My 50 lb. German Shorthair Pointer is far from a Pit Bull, Doberman, Rottweiler, or any other breed that you would think would rip right through any toy given to them. But yet he had the center black ring ripped off from tugging on it within 2 days after he received it as a ""Christmas gift."" After ripping 1 apart, we started playing tug with the remaining rings. He has successfully ripped through the second ring within another week. The rings have 4 indented ""ribbed"" sections per ring, which give them 4 weak points. This is where each of these rings are breaking up.I will go back to Kong toys, which were long-term toys for my previous Doberman and not mess with the lesser competition.",dogs
26,"I paid for functionality, storage, and appearance; I received none of these. Like the 2011 review, what I received is not what is pictured or described. The stand they sent doesn't match that reviewer's description - no gray or chrome - all black. There is no storage space. The unit is just three planks (only 23"" tall instead of the 27 advertised) made of sturdy wood (or maybe wood-like). These assemble in an H formation. There are also two disks to put top and bottom. The disks are not 14"" in diameter as specified, but 13.75"" and with the beveling there's less than 13"" diameter of usable space. It's wobbles easily on carpet, tile, linoleum and hardwood. I will not risk using it for my Hex5 tank - which had been it's intended purpose. I might consider putting a one-gallon aquarium on it if I didn't have pets, kids, or anyone who might accidentally brush against it and send my betta to an untimely demise.

28,"I bought this for my 3 pound Yorkie who quickly (10 minutes) figured out how to unscrew the toy and get all the treats at once. The screw system seems like it should have more resistance, but the dog was ability to spin it open and empty it. Once the treats are gone, the dog loses interest in the toy.",dogs
29,"I've purchased Nutriberries for my pionus parrots for years. The price keeps increasing over time. But, these were purchased at the lowest price on the web at the time. I haven't found a parrot food that is so universally loved by my birds. My only complaint is that they fall apart so easily. I would estimate that only about a quarter of each nugget is actually ingested by my birds. And, that may be an over estimate. Still, no matter what they eat, it's the same story. Most of what they eat ends up on the bottom of the cage.",birds
30,"I recieved this stand and pulled it out of the box and began to set it up.

These stairs were a lifesaver.",dogs
35,I have owned a whisper filter in the past and find them a superior product. So I was not hesitant to buy this one. The whisper does work better than most standard filter systems that come with aquariums these days. So thats why after 1 month I ditched the Aqueon filter system that came with the tank I purchased and switched to the Whisper filter. The only thing I would say that is negative is the sound... it isn't a whisper at all.. more like a water fall in your house. So if you find the sound of running water irritating this isn't the system for you. I find it soothing so it isn't a problem.,fish aquatic pets
36,I purchased this toy for my puppy many months ago and it is still one of her favorites. She didn't quite figure out how to the bees out at first but now loves digging them out with her snout. I sometimes put kibble in there with the bees (and other stuffed toys and she has a ball! She actually enjoys the bees by themselves even more. After many months 2 of the bees have bits chewed off their wings but she pretty much just loves carrying them around and sqeaking them or having me toss them for catching. If you have a heavy chewy they might just destroy them but it is working great for us. My dog is now 11 months and 27lbs.,dogs
37,We have a 55gal planted tank that we wanted to add some night lighting too in addition to the LED's in our hood. Our water was perfectly clear when I put these in. Unfortunately they were not really bright enough to have any affect. I would guess that 4 or 5 would be required to adequately light our tank. At that price we would be better off buying the LED light kit that comes with a hub and has lights that plug into that.There is also the issue that 4 or 5 of these would require there own power strip and timer.,fish aquatic pets
38,These are the only treats my Yorkie will eat. First introduced by her vet at a ridiculous price. They keep her teeth super white and she never has doggy breath. I only rated 4 stars because they're not made in the USA. I get 5 packages through Amazon for the price of one at the vet.,dogs

41,"A few months back, we rescued a tiny little dog who had a horrific mouth - there was no way to avoid a HUGE bill for cleaning up her itty bitty mouth (she had an abscessed tooth, several that were loose, etc.). My vet recommended a similar product, but it had xylitol in it (which can be toxic to dogs) ... and the hunt was on for a product without this ingredient. Enter Dental Fresh! For a couple days my dogs looked at me like I'd lost what little mind they give me credit for - then they started drinking the 'treated' water like normal tap water. Since I have several dogs, I bought a couple 2qt containers to keep in the fridge with their water. A mere 1.5 oz of Dental Fresh takes care of a 2qt container of water. Since we also have a 3gal water container for them all to drink from ... I got out my calculator and did the math. 1 cup of Dental Fresh treats the 3gal water container. My tiny one's breath is noticeably fresher, and even though we didn't have other ""stench mouthed"" dogs in the house, all have breath that is much fresher to the human nose. If I'd known about Dental Fresh before, I'd have been using it for a long long time. As it is now? I will become a regular customer ... for the sake of my dog's gums and teeth ... and my nose!",dogs
42,I had purchased the Palisades II backpack which is at least 6 times the cost of this one and found this one to work much better for my dog. I couldn't believe the low price.

I have been using this salmon oil for several years now, my dogs are in great shape, with glossy coats and absolutely no skin flakes of any type whatsoever. The oil smells pretty fishy and the dogs love it when I squirt it onto their food. The bottle lasts a long time and has saved me many vet. bills. Before I began using this with my dogs, they had skin issues which involved a visit to a vet.I highly recommend this for all dogs, especially older dogs exhibiting signs of flaky skin.UPDATE- August, 2010This is just the best supplement for your dog. I have used this for years now, my old dogs have beautiful coats and supple, non-itchy skin. It helps their elderly joints and prevents problems with my younger dogs. It is beautifully presented in a very easy to use container. I can not recommend this enough. I have really noticed the difference between my dogs and the dogs of those not using the Salmon Oil. I do not especially recommend this brand, it is a good brand and I usually use this brand because it is a bit cheaper and I am a Prime member, with free shipping. I think that all of the wild Salmon oils available are equally good, if the ingredients are the same,",dogs

Incredible customer service when compared to Comcast or other large companies. I would give it more stars except that I wish that cleaning the product were better documented.

She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling. Our Bear (6 yr.

73,"First of all, setting up this feeder is the simplest thing ever. There is only one button, which pressed repeatedly, allows to select 1, 2 or 3 meals/day that have been preprogrammed at the most logical time interval of each other (that is 24h, 8h, and 6 hours, respectively). The first meal is repeated at same hour each day, which coincides with the time you set the feeder. It's up to you to decide when you want to feed your fishes the first meal each day. I don't see any problem with that, unlike many other people before me did.The canister that holds the food is a lot bigger than you can see in the picture, most of it being hidden in the main body of the feeder. It probably can hold same amount as one of the Tetra 29 g (1.02oz) of flake food. That's (a lot) more than a month worth of food for my fishes, so no worries here. The amount of food that is dispensed at each time can be adjusted and if the amount of food still doesn't seem to be sufficient for the number of fishes you may have, I would suggest to try more frequent meals, I mean more than 1 or 2. 3 meals a day is a little too much from my experience, while 1 is not quite enough. 2 meals a day should be ideal I'd say. Another option would be buying some feeder that is double in price or even buying 2 feeders and put them to run in the same time. I guess you have to be inventive, but for any normal amateur aquarist this type of feeder is ideal and meets their needs.The mounting is done the most natural by placing the feeder on the hood of your aquarium, and nothing else being necessary to keep it in place, although 2 velcro strips are provided. No clamp is provided but I believe that is obvious from the image. If, for any reason you can only mount the feeder by using a clamp, the alternative is to get a cheap clamp from a Dollar store but my tanks need cover anyway or else the fishes will jump out.I even like that there is the option to connect it to the air pump so clumping is prevented. I don't know if that would happen otherwise, but I decided to use the air as well. The pressure isn't high enough to see flakes flying , but the producer made sure that the air supply is cut in the time of feeding to prevent an overdose. That being said, I believe this feeder to be very good for what it is intended, and paying more would only matter for bragging rights, not performance.There is an update I'd like to add to what I have previously stated. After some time using two of these feeders, I have noticed that the small plastic clips that keep the canister in the body of the feeder have a very good chance to break. So you have to be careful when inserting or taking out the canister for a refill and also make sure you buy a good, intact unit. I am however considering different remedies, since plastic clips aren't going to set me back now. On a market invaded by cheaply made chinese products this isn't a surprise or is it (this product is actually Italian)?",fish aquatic pets

One of the 10 year old cats was around 2 living on the street when I found him. The 2 younger cats were betweeen 3-4 months old also starving in the streets when I took them in. They are all fixed/micro-chipped and after their experience not really fussy what they eat. NOT ONE SINGLE CAT will TOUCH this stuff. I cannot hide even a little bit in their beloved canned Fancy Feast as they will completely ignore it and just eat the dry cat food. I am going to give it to my friend who has a dog. Maybe she will have better luck. I do not recommend this product.,cats
80,"I bought this set, even though some of the reviews mentioned it was cheap -- but for the price, I figured, what the heck. My main goal was to see if my husky puppy (5 months old, 35 pounds) would like it and I can enroll in classes and/or buy better equipment. I have used this product 5 or 6 times so far -- and it is great! I walk my dog a lot, so maybe that is why he is not creating ""holes"" in the tunnel as others have said (possible if your dogs nails are long -- if you walk him a lot - you should havn't this problem). The tunnel is sturdy and I have had no issues at all. The jump poles work really well also. I have not yet used the weave poles, as that is supposed to be the hardest to train, but I would expect the poles to hold up as well as the jump pole. For my needs -- this product was excellent!",dogs

But its not a big problem.I have it under my desk at the moment, and when its time to clean it, I just pull it out from under my desk, and roll.Its a very good design, it makes it easy.The tabs to keep it closed could be a bit easier, but its not a problem. Other then that, I love it!",cats

83,"I had a similar experience as E. A. Bujak ""bbujak"". I saw this in stores and found it cheaper on Amazon through one of their sellers. I checked the chemical levels before putting doing a regular water change and putting in the Ammonia Alert sensor, everything was where it normally is before doing a change (slightly elevated PH nitrites, nitrates, and ammonia). The next day I checked the levels again, and they were where they normally are after a regular water change. A week went by and the Ammonia Alert never changed color, so I did my regular change and didn't test, thinking everything was OK. Another week goes by and I notice my tank critters starting to act odd, and one fish missing the tips of it's fins. I checked the levels and there were high nitrites, nitrates and ammonia-but the sensor had never changed color to warn me, at all. The sensor came out immediately and I did daily water changes until all the chemical levels went back to where they should be, and gradually increased the time between changes back to weekly changes as the levels stayed where they should be. I tested the sensor by holding it over an open bottle of ammonia, as per the instruction on the package, and there was zero change. Neither Seachem or the seller or Amazon would stand behind this product that put my fish in danger.The only thing I trust to leave in my tank and give me accurate real-time readings is the thermometer.This review may only be legally shown directly on Amazon.com",fish aquatic pets

85,"I use Bed Buddys and put one on my 17 YO Border/Aussie mix since his hips hurt him a great deal. With this much colder than usual weather, I decided to give this a try when I noticed he was laying on the hard floor next to my oxygen concentrator, which puts out heat, but then his hip hurt so much he couldn't get up.At first when I had him lie on his bed on the disc, he looked like 'I don't want to lie here right now, I.... OH Yeah, right there!"", a very contented look on his face. I put the heated disc on his giant bed in the morning so he can move to it or away from it as he wants to, and mostly he is using it. The disc is about 12"" diameter and comes with a washable cover that is like a half circle you slide the disc in, and the top flaps close with Velcro. Also, the instructions say the disc can be heated with or without the cover, which sounds different than the way it used to be. I like to just keep the cover on, that way I don't need any hot pads to remove it from the Micro. The package says it holds the heat for 10 hours, while the description of the product says 12 hours, however I'm not sure how long it stays warm. As of now, I heated it this morning at 7 AM, it's 2 PM now and it's still warm. It would be nice if this company put out a flexible pet warmer as well, so I could drape the flexible one over the top hip, and he can lay on the disc on the bottom hip.",cats
86,"I have been running the Marineland C-220 for about 16 months on a 30 gallon saltwater aquarium.In general, this filter has had good flow, and been quiet and good filtration capability. With a monthly cleaning and replacement of media, water has been consistently clear and tested within acceptable parameters. Replacement media is a bit expensive in local stores, but can be had for much less online. Some items, such as foam pads and polishing pads, are easily cleaned for reuse.However, after one year of use, this filter began developing problems. First, the leaks developed. Leaks where the hoses attach to the valve block assembly, where the block assembly connects to the motor head, in the valve block shut off valve and even the main seal where the motor head clamps onto the canister. All the o-rings and seals appear to be fine and clean, but they will still sporadically develop leaks.The impeller has also had sporadic problems with chattering and changes in flow, even when the unit is properly primed and all air is evacuated.Last night, during a routine water change, all the problems converged in a single grand failure. The impeller failed and is now chattering loudly and no longer pumping. The primer seems to have lost its ability to pump. And, the canister is leaking from all four areas mentioned above at the same time.My question today is do I spend the $50-$60 dollars for a new impeller, o-rings and valve block, or simply start over.",fish aquatic pets

Decided to look online and see if I could take advantage of my trial amazon prime service and sure enough found this product and available for amazon prime shipping. Which was even better. Received it fast and furious with no addition shipping cost anddddd... the best part??? 25 dollars cheaper then I was about to spend at Petco. Same exact product practically and much cheaper.

127,"I am going to make this short and sweet, since there are MANY good reviews and just a few very bad reviews. What to believe heh?Here is the scoop (or 'roll' I should say). This product does what it says, and I have owned those automatic cat boxes for years. This is cleaner and easier to use. You may wonder about that since it is technically not &#34;automatic&#34;. But it is SO much better that the automatic cat boxes AND LESS EXPENSIVE. My automatic cat box broke, so I bought this instead and I am glad I did. I will NEVER go back to the automatic cat boxes again!Now I have noticed a few people complaining that it either falls apart or the sand comes out when rolling or that the slide hooks (that hold the top portion to the bottom) don't fit, work or come apart. I have to agree that the hooks could be engineered a bit tougher or better, but that being said it is STILL a great produce. I have NO problem with sand coming out when I roll it, and I am a bit confused on how that would even happen (IF) done correctly.Every time I go to &#34;roll&#34; my cat box I just look at the connecting hooks to make sure they are secure. If I notice they are a bit to loose I re-secure them before rolling. Simple as that. Ultimately, I may drill a few holes into the top and bottom lid lip (where they meet) and just simply zip tie them together. But for now that is not something I need to do. BUT EVEN IF I wind up doing that I will still be purchasing two more of these cat boxes. (I own 3 very large cats)So even with a few minor imperfections I would STILL highly recommend this product! Just check to make sure everything is still secure before rolling if you are worried about it coming apart. (Which it never has happened to me.)",cats

147,"I've seen this collar on dogs in my neighborhood and I thought it's a muzzle. Fortunately, I met an owner of a dog with this collar and I asked him what it is for. I have a 2-year old very feisty German Shepherd and walking her is getting to be a problem. She behaves when it's just us, but as soon as she sees a dog or any other animal she goes berserk. She would act like I was invisible. She's actually very friendly and she does that because she wants to say hi to the dog or person. Dog-lovers understand that it's her puppy energy, but most people get scared and write her off as a bad, ill-mannered dog.I read the instructions before putting the collar on her and as expected, she bucked like a horse in the first 10 minutes. I then took her outside our yard to distract her and eventually she calmed down and walked by my side! I didn't even have to use treats! She's so used to walking way ahead of me for a long time so sometimes she would try that, but I would keep my hand firmly at my side and when she feels the tension on the leash, she would slow down again. I never had to tug at the leash except when she's sniffing something on the ground and wouldn't respond to ""come."" I've been using the collar on her for 2 days now and I'm happy to say that she's become so much easier to walk.What I have to work on next is having her sit or stay when we encounter a dog or a person she knows. As soon as she sees another dog, she would pull. When she does that, she would feel the collar on her face so she would buck like an untamed horse. When this happens, I would push her butt down to sit and try to calm her down.My husband and I are very happy with this product. We never thought we would be able to make her walk by our side. Before buying this, I read the comparison review on the different halter collars and I'm happy I went with this one. It fits my dog's head well and the nose loop doesn't chafe her snout like some complaints I read. I think the fitting is crucial. If the collar is loose around the back of the neck, then the nose loop would move around and rub on the dog's face. The next time I get a puppy, I will train it as early as possible with this collar.",dogs
148,"I'm not normally one to buy clothes for my dog, but this was an excellent purchase! The fur on my dog's back and sides started thinning and falling out inexplicably this winter. I needed something to keep him warm during the Chicago winter while I treat the hair loss.The coat is very well made with a nice soft fleece lining. What I like best are the straps! My dog hates coats that go on over his head. But instead of a hole for his head to fit through, this coat has straps that you wrap around the dog's neck. It's like laying a blanket over his back. The straps fasten easily and securely with velcro. It's easy to adjust, so my dog never feels choked or confined by the coat. Same with the straps that fasten around his chest / belly. He's a pit bull mix and has a rather thick neck and chest. The straps are long enough to reach around him and hold the coat securely in place without being confining.We've gone for 30-minute walks in single-digit temps, and his skin is still nice and warm underneath the coat when we got back. Couldn't be happier about that!My dog is about 26&#34; long from the base of his neck to the base of his tail and weighs 86 lbs (yes, he's about 10 lbs overweight, and the coat still accommodates his pudge).

156,I purchased this gate thinking my really young kittens wouldn't get over it so easily to get them use to the new house though of course being kittens this simple gate won't stop from going over. So of course this gate didn't really serve the purpose I had in mind for it. Though with that being said I still think this gate is a great gate for animal owners as it really is a sturdy gate that isn't easily going to be toppled over with a nudge or light push. If you own a dog and cat this will give the cat easy access to all rooms in the house while making sure the dog doesn't go into other areas or as well as keeping young babies/small children from accessing parts of the house as well.The door latch is really easy to use and with plenty of &#34;walk-Thru&#34; room to go through the gate and close behind you with an easy snap. This is a really good gate to have and HIGHLY recommend it for those that have a need for a gate in their house.,dogs
157,Worked for our lab retriever mix who liked to go out and bark just to see if he'd get any answer from the neighbor dogs. Used it everytime he went out for the first 4-5 days. He'd bark once and that was it. Now we use it off and on but he has stopped barking so I think he really doesn't need it anymore. I highly recommend this product.,dogs

Also, it comes in a huge cardboard box that could fit a midget inside. When you open it, its about 15 square feet of paper, and 5 cubic feet of empty space.",dogs
161,"My dog is an American Bull Dog. She is pink skinned with white fur and she has Blue eyes. She is very sensitive to food such as chicken, pork, etc which is in all dog food products. She would vomit and have diarrhea daily. Her skin would produce a very strong odor which was diagnosed as a yeast infection on the top skin. She can only eat oatmeal and salmon, made by GO!. The heat, and regular dog food affected her skin with hives, shedding to the point of bald spots. This shampoo is excellent for all dogs, it doesn't matter if they have allergies or not. Hives, infection, balding, yeast infection, allergy reaction from something they ate including animal poop this product will heal the skin and alleviate itching. VERY GOOD. I bathe my dog in this product weekly and sometimes twice/week without any side effects to the skin. She is relaxed and her skin and coat is bright and clean. This product keeps your dogs skin and fur odor free for up to 5 days even in the hot weather. I highly recommend this shampoo for your dog whether he/she is pink skinned or not. I have been bathing my dog with this since I got her when she was 4 months old. She is now 2 years old (human years). Check out the one for CATS!",cats
162,"I got the Air Kong Squeaker Dog Bone for my yellow Labrador retriever, Daisy, about eight months ago. She loved the squeak, which is (was) very pleasant and not loud and annoying like some of her other squeaky toys. We play fetch a lot and she enjoys running after it and bringing it back to us. She's a chewer and it didn't take long for her to start chewing on this toy. For a while I thought it was going to survive her teeth, but alas, after a few weeks she had made it through the fabric and into the rubber. It didn't take long before the squeaker was gone (she missed that and tried for the longest time to make it squeak again) and then the bone shape started shrinking as she chewed off the rubber in pieces.We still have what's left of the toy and we still play fetch with it some, but mostly Daisy just likes to chew it and pull off more rubber. (She doesn't swallow it.) The bone is about half its original size now, but I don't really mind. In fact, I'll be buying her another one in the near future. A ten dollar investment for her to chew on for many months isn't so bad when you look at how many shoes and other things she hasn't chewed and how much she's enjoyed it!",dogs
163,"This product appeared to work well, and was recommended to me by a dog training professional. I can understand and see where this product would work but it did not have any effect on my dog. He gets very anxious and excited and incessantly barks at the neighbors dogs. I got this product to try and prevent this from happening since he will not stop for hours. This product did not even slow my dog down from barking. In the beginning when I filled the collar he did not like it and acted kind of shy, but once he was used to the smell it had no effect. When he would bark and the collar sprayed him he would on shake his head, maybe sneeze and start coughing. All the while he continued to bark at the neighbors dog. After just a few days of use I have had to stop using this collar because my dog was coughing all the time, sneezing constantly and I was afraid it was going to start harming him. I will have to try another route for his anxiety and barking. For dogs that are not overly anxious this would be a great product. I think personally I need to upgrade to the collar with a remote and try to train him before being sprayed that the remote beep means stop. This might have better luck.",dogs

The rake gets caught and sometimes poo will become airborne. I had to clean it once, got the gloves and mask on (pregnant) due to my husband being out at sea. Well, apparently he isnt as thourough as I am because when I moved the unit, there was a big pile of the littermaid special 10.00 a small bag litter at the bottom of my carpet. I had to go out and buy a carpet cleaner to clean up the mess. Not only that, but my cat misses the litterbox quite frequently much to my dismay, and has a facination with the poop receptical.

It took some time for the cage to arrive but when it did, the box was ripped and when my daughter and wife removed the cage from the box, all the wire panels were bent.

We have a jack russell with short spiney hair and we also have a bernese mountain dog and a golden retriever .... this product did make it easier to remove hair from the furniture and the floor. ALSO, I did one section of the inside walls of our pool and loved it!! Later today, I'll use the rubber brush for the outdoor furniture and I expect good results.

I'd open it up and try to fix it but I suspect my frustration level in opening/closing the ball would skyrocket. Simply not worth the trouble.

LOL In the past, using other brushes, we could brush and brush and brush and still not come near getting all the loose hair out.

But LitterMaid figured this out and has cut the thickness of their replacement containers in half so if you even LOOK at them too hard, they will crack. Don't expect to get more than 2 uses out of the replacement containers.

When you own two cats, the cat hair problem can get a little bad.It did take them a few days to get used to the food.

I sprayed the cover and let it sit before washing it (I washed it because I figured a double dose of cleaning couldn't hurt!), then soaked the foam in spray. After the spray dried there was no hint of cat pee smell. (The microsuede cover didn't have any discoloring or staining from the spray either.) There was also a fleece sweatshirt on the couch during the pee incident.

203,"The Dental Kong with a rope is a great toy for dogs who like to chase things and chew on them. And that includes most dogs. This toy sort of simulates say a small pray animal that dogs normally would chase. I throw it and my dog chases after it. When she gets it she shakes it around vigorously like a dog would do if it caught say a rabbit and then chews on it. The ropes are easily chewed threw by heavy chewers in a short period of time but the rope is made of cotton so there is no danger if the dog ingests small pieces of the rope. And the Kong Company sells replacement ropes with instructions for tying the special knots at each end for a nominal charge and they don't charge anything for shipping them. Don't be tempted to use replacement ropes made of anything but cotton, nylon or polypropylene for example from other sources, as this material will harm your dog if ingested.I would give this dog toy five stars if the ropes lasted longer but that is the only shortcoming in this terrific toy and I really don't see how the toy could have the appeal it does for my dog without the rope.",dogs

Nothing I tried was significantly thinning out or shortening his multi-layered coat, and it was heartbreaking to watch him constantly trying to groom himself.Enter The FURminator. If I could sell cat hair, I'd be rich right now! Bushels of the stuff just kept coming off of him for as long as I kept combing. I could probably completely denude my hairy guy if I wanted to!

Both are profuse shedders and the long-hair gives rise to numerous messy hairballs. Well, what're we gonna do? We're always cleaning up after them and have tried a variety of combs and small rakes. My wife saw a TV commercial about the Furminator and she just had to try it out of desperation. We purchased it at a local pet store, and it was way overpriced.This deshedding tool is just astonishingly effective. With the first use, it was almost hard to believe the amount of hair that this thing can remove from a cat! We almost filled a waste basket with cat hair from the two cats! We laughed and laughed at the sight. I still can't believe it! I've never seen anything so effective. Did the cats struggle? Not a bit. In fact they both seemed to enjoy it and they came back for stroke after stroke.Finding this Furminator was a stroke of good luck. Hopefully, the hairball problem will now be lessened and the amount of loose cat fur around the house will be greatly diminished. It was expensive, but well worth it!Gary Peterson",cats

I find that to trim the hair around the paws beforehand will allow less mess and less chance of matting the fur in any excess glue. The glue applicator sometimes dries out (we go 2-3 weeks between applications) so that's a minor quibble -- however I don't see us not using this product as both we and our dog appreciate the benefits to our house and her ability to make tight corners. :o)",dogs

So I know what I'm talking about.The Litter Robot beats them all. I bought one about 3 months ago, and it is outstanding. If you've owned a rake model automatic box, then you know how much it can jam, how quickly it can fill up with multiple cats, and how awkward emptying it is.Yes the Litter Robot is way more money. But imagine a box that NEVER jams and has a much LONGER time in between cleanings. Now imagine that cleaning the box doesn't involve purchasing and changing liners (like the PetMate model), or disposable plastic boxes (like the LitterMaid). The Litter Robot just has a drawer, that you use standard waste paper basket bags in.No more buying liners and waste boxes. And it even uses less litter. The process of emptying it is based on gravity, and by dumping instead of raking, the unused litter doesn't get disposed like those other models.Buy this box whether you've owned an automatic cat box before, or if this is your first one.

225,"I've had this collar for a while now... maybe a year or so, no more than two years. I thought that it had been working okay. It was certainly stopping her from barking most of the time (she's very territorial and barks at every moving thing around). Note that I say it only stopped her most of the time. The collar didn't pick up on every bark. Recently, however, the collar has had some serious sensor malfunctions. She'll bark for a solid minute before she gets a correction (this is on a new battery). More serious, however, is that she gets a correction seemingly at random. I was concerned that in the year I've been using this collar, Bubbles never ever got the hint that barking caused the correction, and now I'm seriously worried that it's because of this random shocking.I wish I could take it back, but the best I can do right now is hope you read this and decided to spend a little more on a collar that you won't have to use forever.",dogs

227,"I first discovered these on a recommendation by the owner of a local pet store in Middleburg, Virginia. He said that it was a product that he couldn't keep on the shelves and it done wonders for many of the owners who come in and bought it. As you can see, I was very skeptical of such a recommendation, but boy was I wrong. My dog is an 11 year old Golden Labrador Mixed. We started giving him the nickname, &#34;Old Man&#34; a few years ago, because he was starting to get up slowly, walk around slowly, wouldn't run, had to stretch and *hated* I mean HATED going up the stairs to go to bed. Now, things are much different.We started giving him 1 treat every morning as his &#34;medicine&#34;. It took about a week and half to fully see the difference, but it was amazing. It was so long since I had seen him run around the house, or run to the door when he thought someone was there knocking. One of the funniest things now is Pizza Night. He knows that when he sees the pizza man or when someone is bringing it over that he's going to have a good night. Either myself or fiance, will take one of our Crusts from the pizza and begin tossing pieces of it it to him. Before he would let it hit him in the face and fall to the ground or we would have to let him eat it from our hands, but now he is snatching it right out of the air when we toss it. He'll jump in the air to catch it if he has too!! One of the biggest differences we have seen, even after all the other things, is that he now runs up the stairs when everyone is ready for bed. That is a big thing for an older dog to do. These treats are amazing.It really has changed his life, and it has made us feel so happy to see him excited and want to run around and play like he was a young dog again. I passed some treats on to a co-worker after telling him all about these changes, and he is now a believer as well.I would recommend these to anyone who has a dog that is starting to slow down because of age. Remember though, It takes about a week or two before it starts working. So, don't be discouraged if its not right away.",dogs

This is made of glued together particle board.Then, there is the issue of the glue. Tons of wood glue and some of it exposed.The ""wood"" around the edges and holes was so rough and splintered and needed sanding.The worse part of all is that the entire thing is put together with metal nails.

241,"My parents have a cat that goes through terrible allergic episodes where he throws up uncontrollably, breaks out on his skin, his fur falls out, and when he uses the litterbox, it stinks horribly. Thing is, they started to notice that this only happens after feeding him the good old grocery store brand, what I affectionately call ""tails n' scales"", catfood. When he eats the cheapo brands, it usually doesn't take long for him to start throwing up, breaking out, and losing fur, and sending everyone in the house on a mission to find deodorizing spray. However, when fed the Science Diet, he never throws up, and, he never gets hairballs, and thankfully, his use of the litterbox isn't smelly. Science Diet catfood is the one and only food that does not make him spin out of control with an allergic reaction. I recommend it to anyone. I firmly believe that most pet food manufacturers could care less what goes into their food. Not true with Science Diet, it is the one and only food that my parents will buy now.

It takes her minutes to chew down any other chewing treats like the bully sticks. I'm not buying those any longer.

253,"My review is not for the product, but for the seller - BUYER BEWARE!The product PHOTO shown above is for Bayer K9 Advantix II. The photo you'll see when you add this product to your cart is for K9 Advantix II. What you'll actually receive from the shipper is K9 Advantix, which Bayer stopped manufacturing in March of 2011. I contacted the seller, asking about the discrepancy and was told ""The photo is NOT of K9 Advantix II, it is just the new packaging they have for the regular K9 Advantix"", prompting me to contact Bayer directly, describing the packaging I received. Bayer actually stopped manufacturing K9 Advantix in March of 2011 and went to K9 Advantix II (pictured above). The difference is the newer product kills flea EGGS, while the original product does not. While I read the description of the product, the photo itself is PURPOSELY misleading and it was until I received the shipment and checked my purchase history, that the photo of the old product appeared.Since my concern is ticks, not fleas, and as there is no expiration date on the product, I will use it rather than go thru the hassle of returning and repurchasing. Bayer did say there was no harm in using it also.

They did a wonderful job cleaning his teeth, however, they chipped off all the tips of his front incisors and canines teeth; all for about $350.00. Ever since that horrible experience I have been leery about professional cleaning. Buddy is now 8, and the tartar build was back again; I decided to take a chance on Petzlife Oral spray. AMAZING product- in one use I saw an improvement. After a week, most of the tartar is completely gone.

257,"I'm very pleased with this cage and so is my Yellow Sided Green Cheek Conure. The Amazon price is very impressive and especially when compared to the well known chain @ $354.99 and close to 3xs when compared to our local privately owned pet store. I opened the package as soon as it arrived (1-day shipping @ $3.99 with prime) and immediately put it together which took approximately 20 min. I prepared myself for major problems after reading some of the reviews, but assembly was a breeze. Instructions were both easy to read and easy to follow, until I got to the cagetop playstand & corner seed guards. It is at this point that you may need to exercise a bit more patience and rely on a little intuition (use the picture as a guide). Once the cage is fully assembled it is beautiful and works very well to my surprise. I half way expected this cage to be inferior to the ones that we've seen in stores, but the inexpensive price does not mean that its cheaper in quality and that was a very nice bonus.Best Features:1) Cage top playstand my conure loves it and we love that this play area has replaced his swing and swing stand, which was incredibly messy at times. (the swing is now inside of the cage)2) Wrout Iron is so nice to have for cleaning compared to plastic on theSuper Pet Habitat Defined Bird Cage, Cockatiel Enrichment Home with Activity Center. We hate that cage, but our little buddy loved the smaller, darker space. The cleaning trays are also a plus and there are two sets. One to catch what the bird leaves behind on the cage top and one for the cage below. Just pull them out completely to empty and clean, then easily slide them back into place.3) Food & water bowls are of great quality and fit nicely into their holders.4) The corner seed guards are the best feature of this cage. In our Conure's old cage/habitat he would continuously toss his food onto the floor. Food and snacks are now easily redirected into the cage with these guards in place, requiring less sweeping and vacuuming. (width with seed guards is approx 26.5"")The transition took approximately 3 days for our Conure and he is now very happy in his new space.",birds
258,"We used to sleep our Boston Terrier in a travel kennel but we decided he need a little more leg room. We got him a wire crate and a Cratewear set. He used to go to his crate reluctantly at night but now, as soon as he sees his nighttime treat, he bolts into his crate, sits, and waits.We've always given him a treat before bed but he still didn't seem happy to crate up. Now, even when I open the door for him in the morning he just kinda stares at me. ""Um, dude, could you come back in half an hour or so? I'm too comfy to get up just yet.""We're rescuing a cocker mix this June and she'll get the same set up.The only thing that brings it down from 5 Starts is that it's a little expensive for canvas and foam. Also the bumper straps, which are designed to attach above the horizontal crate wires, are immoble. Which means (on some crates) the bumper doesn't reach down to the pad. Small gripe.",dogs

260,"The low rating is due to the fact that my determined 10-pound cat merely turned the inner compartmentalized tray with her paw, within 5 minutes of seeing the unit for the first time, thus, revealing the food-filled adjacent compartments. When she found the automatic feeder, the first day I set it up, it was 8 hours before her next regular feeding (she was not hungry), yet after smelling food in the unit, she dutifully used her paw to turn the food tray ahead one compartment.The fatal flaw is that the fully enclosed compartmentalized tray does not lock into position when resting between timed feedings and is incredibly easy to rotate; no real physical force is required to advance the tray to the next one or several (food-filled) compartments. Only some level of interest in the enclosed food, in conjunction with a slight amount of determination is required for the animal to rotate the tray, at will.Years ago, we did use another automatic timed feeder with this same cat, the Cat Mate C20, which is a 2-meal, flip-lid type of feeder. We would fill up both compartments for the day, and she would immediately lift up both lids with her paw within minutes after it had been filled. That unit also was no match for our obsessive eater.Our cat is not large in size, nor has she provided any evidence that she is particularly clever, particularly strong, or particularly intelligent, she's just one obsessive (determined) cat regarding her food. My cat joins the ranks of the other reviewers, whose animals very simply pushed the tray around, at will, with little force. We had the identical problem as the 10/1/07 reviewer named E. Genzoli, whose Boston Terrier, moved the inner compartmentalized tray around with his face after 3 months of use and the 9/11/07 reviewer named NashvilleLady333 whose Australian Shepherd, also moved the compartments ahead at will after only ""days."" My 10 pound cat moved the inner tray around at will with her front paw within 5 minutes of our ownership of the Petsafe PF5-11. This unit has a design flaw which is fatal if your pet's history regarding food intake reflects even a slight level of determination.In summary, if your pet is somewhat determined and/or intelligent, then this unit's design failure (the non-locking compartmentalized food tray) will become apparent in no time, making the unit completely useless for its intended purpose of timed feedings. The pet need not be strong, heavy, clever, brilliant, nor be a dog in order to exploit the fatal design flaw of the non-locking compartmentalized tray. We have ordered the Super Feeder CSF-3; it may be our only hope for sleeping in, in the morning with our adorable, but food-obsessed cat.",cats

He really loves this toy, because it gives him something to focus on and work for.I haven't noticed any smell as other reviewers have wrote. My terrier is a heavy chewer, but any dog with a bit of sense in them will realize that it's a quicker payoff to roll the ball around than to chew through the ball. My terrier did try chewing through it at first, but as with all toys you need to supervise your dog and make sure they play with it as intended. After correcting him when he tried chewing on it he watched my other dog roll it around and quickly picked up on what he was supposed to do.My only complaint is that when you get to the final bits of treats it may not come out unless you shake the ball violently.",dogs

Even at a sale price, it was probably the most expensive grooming tool I personally have ever bought!My cat is a Maine Coon and a shedding machine. So I thought I'd try it first on him. And yes, the comb got out a lot of hair. But I just didn't see any difference in the results that I got with it versus the undercoat rake that I typically use (and that cost me about $[...]). I still had hair floating all around the room and a day later, he was still shedding fur all over the house again. I was hoping he would object less to getting combed out with this tool as well, but no such luck, he still growled and hissed through the whole session.Moving on to my sheltie, my results with him were even worse. This comb pulls out the overcoat, the guard hairs that they do not shed! And left plenty of undercoat behind in the process. It is totally useless on a long-haired, double-coated breed like this, not only leaving the loose hair underneath behind, but actually *damaging* the coat! I will not ever be using this comb on my sheltie(s) again, even an undercoat rake does not pull out guard hairs the way this comb did.Overall, totally disappointed in this overpriced tool. I gave it 2 stars for at least doing a decent enough job on my cat. But for the price, I expected much better.",cats

We also find it easier to use than the 'scissor' type clipper, but be sure to get some replacement blades, otherwise you will begin to shred your cat's claws.We've been using the Resco brand trimmer ever since our Humane Society friend clued us into the product. It's a very sturdy clipper and the blades are easy to replace--just don't remove the two little screws like I did before reading the directions--press down on the blade ejector tab and the blade pops right out.These are heavy-duty blades, and you can go for quite awhile (up to a year) between replacements.",dogs

The three stars are all from her.I bought this toy because a friend has two cats who have enjoyed their Turbo Scratcher for a decade.Two problems with the one I received:#1 - The ball wasn't round. Badly molded plastic that went far too slowly around the track with an egg-like wump wump motion. I replaced it with a golf ball, and that works fine, maybe even better than a properly formed plastic ball would.#2 - The color. It wasn't possible to choose the color of this toy when ordering. My cat may not be offended by a pukey shade of turquoise, but I am. I was hoping for dark green, gray, even red--anything but pukish turquoise. I may hide it when friends come over. I'm pretty sure the hue has already decreased the resale value of my home.I suppose it's marginally unfair to gripe about the color when the product title includes ""colors may vary.""

He sleeps in it, jumps in it and digs in it while at home.

Usually, we have pretty good luck with the various soft chew, squeaker toys but sometimes she shakes it so hard there is a tiny rip and the stuffing is showing. If the hole is not too large, I mend it and give it back to her. The Bone is a nice size, good quality, was packaged very well, and arrived on promised delivery date.",dogs
287,"I spent days looking and researching various cat trees. I read about a million reviews and finally decided on this product.I was sceptical about ordering it - I don't live in the U.S. and had to ship this internationally (makes returns quite difficult). This product arrived in 2 boxes weighing about 100lbs. Everything was there and nothing was damaged or broken. Instructions come in a form of a drawing and are very clear and straight forward. Assembly took about 40 minutes (I did it by myself).The quality of the product is great, nothing flimsy about the carpet or posts or platforms/houses whatsoever, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I am very happy with this product. The platforms are spacious and not overly wobbly (just a litte bit but that is to be expected when you have three hyped cats jump up and down this tree with 70 miles an hour).So much for MY opinion. Now, what do my three 7 months old girls think? They LOVE it. They were all over this while I was still unpacking everything. They are on this tree all the time. They play on it and they sleep on it. They are using everything this cat tower has to offer.So, 5 stars from me and 5 stars from my kittys.This is a great buy, if you have any doubts, throw them out!",cats

The balls are double-walled and cannot be deflated. I've purchased 4 of these balls and they have lasted for years. That's amazing when most toys last a week if you're lucky. My dog loves for me to throw the ball and he drags it back by the rope. Eventually (and because we leave them outside all winter in the Oregon rain - the toys, not the dogs :) the ropes wear out, but the balls are still fun to play with because my dog can pick it up by grabbing the edge of the hole where the rope used to be.

We had tried several remedies without much success. Last fall, we remodeled our family room and we were determined to keep the new room ""pristine"". We heard about Feliway and decided to give the diffuser a try.Feliway actually worked! We put 1 diffuser in the living room (same old carpet and furniture as before) and 1 in the remodeled family room (all new materials). Marking stopped in both rooms, as well as in areas that are immediately adjacent. In the past 6 months or so that we've used Feliway, we've had 1 episode of a cat peeing on some papers, so the problem isn't 100% cured, but the improvement over daily marking is huge. (We did get a recurrence of some vertical spraying in 1 room when we were late in refilling the diffuser. Refilling it stopped the behavior again).Feliway isn't cheap, but it still costs less than cleaning or replacing damaged furniture, paint and carpets. It's no work --just plug it in-- and the house smells good again. Hallelujah.",cats

We bought the &#34;talking ball&#34; some time ago, and we (AND our dog!) just loved it. It was a lot of fun watching her chase it around while it &#34;taunted&#34; her....! But this one was apparently only defective in its production. I returned it per the return instructions, and had requested a &#34;replacement&#34; -- but found I had received a &#34;credit&#34; on my account instead. That was a bit disappointing, too....

One time the water was overflowing so I looked it over and realized the removable pump filter was clogged with hair. A quick and easy fix and the problem was solved. Now I know to clean the unit more often since it was in need of a cleaning when this happened.The cats really love this fountain. When I am cleaning it, they sit around watching me to make sure I put it back together. Seriously, it gets their attention when I pick it up off of the floor for any reason. They will sit in the kitchen and meow for it until it is ready for them.All you have to do is keep it clean. Honestly, If you are too lazy to clean your cat's water bowl then you need to ask yourself if you are ready for pets.To clean:I carefully disassemble the unit every 2-3 weeks and run the grey parts through the dishwasher (top rack). I also submerge the pump in soapy water and run it for about ten minutes to clean it, then do the same with non-soapy water to rinse, then allow it to air-dry. We've had this unit for a year now.

Before I could check it out, my husband let him off the leash, and said it didn't even shock the dog as he went through the wireless fence. Dog got away with the $140 collar, before we could get him.The dog came back three weeks later. After checking out the collar, it apparently works fine. It just has a lot larger range than the wireless fence says it should. This could be good or bad depending on your needs. We have a larger yard than average. With my original collar my other dog can't go past the yard. With this collar, this dog can go into the street, the woods behind the house, and the shock is not strong enough (even though we had his neck shaved) to bother him. I haven't tried it on my other dog to see if it is strong enough to bother him, because he is trained now not to go that far anyway. I also would never shock him just to see if the collar voltage is strong enough for the average dog.Therefore, it may work well for you, or it may not, depending on your dog.",dogs

I emphasize ""aid"" as, unfortunately, there is no easy one-size-fits-all solution to addressing any animal behavioral issue. Any anti-bark device may only work as part of a training routine that can potentially require a aignificant amount of time and effort on the owner's part.My experience with the PetSafe began poorly. I received the item with a dead battery. It is unique to PetSafe products and is only available from limited places (online and some pet stores, so don't expect to run to your local big-box retailer and find these).

I also have eight rabbits who shed a lot!! It works GREAT on them too! I even plan on buying the smaller brush for my rabbits because the large was it a little too big.

Enter the springs. They're great because my cats enjoy chasing them down the hallway (they make a lovely sound on hardwood floors) and when my cats attempt to pick them up or stop them they'll often spring away, leading the cats on another chase.

So now I have 6 hamsters (girls because I put the boys in another set of cages) and this is the best cage because it is sooooo easy to clean, you just unsnap one orange hing on either side and lift up the plastic to clean, and my hamsters really love it here and I can just remove the purple lid on the side to have them come out so I can pet them. The wheel is really nice and it's inside the cage so the hamsters don't throw stuff all over my floor and it's true that it gets loud after you have it for a while but if you put a tiny bit of corn oil on the part that connects it to the cage it will stay quiet.

I know that they can't say specifically, because it would probably depend on the issue you are trying to treat, but if they could at least say give anywhere from 10-100000 a day in general that would help out a LOT. The vet I most recently went to was the typical all about the money man who milks every person for every dime he can & quite frankly shouldn't have been working with cats in the first place (he was obviously uncomfortable handling them). When I asked him about fiber options the ONLY thing he recommended was a Science Diet food that he was getting high dollar paid for selling (they are known for pushing that brand at their office) I had to research on my own to find these treats & when I called them about possibly getting an idea of how many to feed daily of course they had no idea. All I can say about most vets these days is one word- GREED!My cat likes the treats- she will eat pretty much any treat though so this was no surprise. I don't know if they are working properly because I got them to help her go to the bathroom more often due to her anal gland issues but so far I haven't noticed if they are doing anything for her.",cats

376,"I bought the Furminator at the recommendation of my Vet. And it really does work. I have a large german shepherd mix, and a small short haired black and white mutt. So there is not a color of clothing that you can wear that you aren't going to end up with hair showing. But with regular brushing (about twice a week, cause I am lazy) the shedding has decreased dramatically, even when my german shepherd blows his coat. And my vacuum doesn't have to be emptied as often. I call that a success. Definitely better than the brush I used before.",cats
377,"I purchased the Furminator on the recommodation of a friend and am very pleased with it. I have 2 smooth coat black & tan daschunds that I didn't think shed much but I was finding their hair all over the place. I bathe them frequently and brushed them with a rubber brush but I can see the dramatic difference with the Furminator. It must feel good to them since they sit calmly for their sessions and I am able to pull out quite a bit of hair - in fact, I have to stop often to pull out the accumulated hair from the blade.Great product - I highly reccomend it.",cats

383,"My cat has serious food allergies. She used to wheeze and breathe loudly--and was also bloated from my misguided, if well intentioned, attempts to feed her a very good quality chicken-based food (*see my other reviews for this brand.)Now, the food was excellent, but poor kitty was allergic to chicken. The vet put her on a veterinary diet that was supposed to be rabbit but seemed to be mostly vegetable. I tried the Nature's Logic Rabbit Dinner instead and the results have been phenomenal. The cat eats it with enthusiasm, has lost a pound, has a coat that is sleek and shiny, and her wheezing and bloated appearance are a thing of the past.Rabbit is an excellent food for cats since it is close to their natural prey (I call it 'uptown mouse')This is an outstanding brand of cat food made by people who seem to really care about what the cats eat. I am very pleased with the product and can recommend it very highly--and so can the cat!",bunny rabbit central

So, if it's important enough to you to keep your animal warm, it will cost you about $30 a year. Perhaps other people have had better luck...but a year to 18 months is all I've been able to get out of mine.",dogs
386,I should have heeded the reviews I read!!!! If you try to use the toy as it comes to you NO treats will come out (no matter the size)!!! You do have to trim the things inside that block the treats. I cut then to be a little less than half the size and its still hard for either of my dogs to get the treats out (a 90 lb. Lab and a Puggle). They get frustrated and give up - which says alot since my Puggle is food obsessed!!!! Its impossible to clean it out to -just rinse well so watch watch treats you put in.

397,"I don't usually take time to write a review but I thought the Drinkwell deserved another review from a happy pet owner. I did a tremendous amount of research trying to find a pet fountain for a large labrador and two cats. We were refilling water bowls constantly and water was all over the floor and the dog's spit in the bowl made for very unhappy kitties (probably dehyrdrated kitties too). My father-in-law ended up getting this a gift for the animals. We couldn't be happier and so are the pets. Our animals drink so much water now and the kitties love drinking from the fountain part. I knew cats liked drinking running water because ours love to drink from a faucet if one of the kids (or me) allow them to. This is the best of both worlds. This thing holds a tremendous amount of water. Even though it holds so much water, we sometimes fill it two to three times per day. That to me is encouraging because it means all three animals are really hydrated (especially important for kitties). Don't see any dog spit in the dish and there isn't a big watery mess around a bowl on the floor. I did set this fountain in an old cookie sheet in case anything spilled. We have had this fountain for almost 6 months and it has been working great. Granted, it isn't the quietest thing but it is in the kitchen and when it starts to make more noise that means one of us hasn't taken the time to fill the reservoir. I thought I would write this review as a thank you to Drinkwell from not only us humans but the animals in our house. I feel so much better knowing that while we are gone during the day, our pets have more than enough to drink and no one is going to step in it, knock it over or intentionally spill it (sigh... dog).Thanks Drinkwell!!!",cats
398,Comfortable material inside and out. Great design and it's just all and all a high quality product. It would be even better if it has more color selection.,dogs
399,"Unlike other reviewers, my cats loved this fountain. I have three, and the fountain did a good job. I only put filtered water into the unit, and I cleaned it weekly.However, this week, my catsitter noticed that the motor had stopped. She unplugged the unit. I came home and thought it might just need cleaning. I discovered that the motor housing had melted. The spinning plastic bit of the motor had fused to the unit.Thank goodness my cat sitter unplugged it. I can't imagine what might have happened if she hadn't.Of course, anyone that has used a fountain knows that once your pets get used to it, they won't drink water any other way. Luckily Petsmart had a stainless steel 360 available. It is a similar motor but smaller. I've used the plastic ones previously. Anyways, I won't go back to the big dog unit after seeing what happened with the motor housing.",dogs
400,"Finally, a toy that keeps our Lab occupied for more that 10 seconds and that she can't chew up, at least as yet. Our lab, Fiona, is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys. We've tried quite a few ""tough"" interactive toys only to have her either figure it out in no time or just get to the heart of the matter and chew her way through to the treats. This is not a complex toy compared to others. However, even though she has tried numerous strategies to get at the treats, this ball makes her work for it keeping her occupied.",dogs
401,"I bought this at the same time I bought the large Kong squeaker bone toy as an alternate shape to provide variety for my dog. It's constructed the same as the bone toy.Does your dog destroy most toys? Do you cringe when you purchase a stuffed toy knowing you'll be picking up the shredded parts from the floor the very next day? You may have discovered buying cheap dog toys just isn't a good idea.If so, this toy may be what you have been searching for. Like most dog owners I was aware of the durability of the hard rubber Kong brand toy. I also found my dog was uninterested in playing with it unless it was stuffed with food or smeared with peanut butter.Well, this one is different. It's a Kong hard rubber dog toy covered with a durable fabric. It seems the fuzzy fabric surface will keep my dog's interest and keep her chewing it while the sturdy rubber interior keeps the toy from being totally destroyed in the first day. The hollow center make it just soft enough for her to squeeze, while the squeaky noise maker helps to keep her interest. With it's football shape, it works as a retrieval toy too.Eventually she will tear the fabric completely off. After a longer time, she will even begin to chew the hard rubber into fragments causing me to have to discard the remains of the toy. They are far, far more durable than anything else I've found. It's definitely a value for the money. My dog is a young, 44 pound, Australian Shepherd. This toy is the largest one Kong makes and it's just the right size for her.They just last longer than any other chew toy I've found.",dogs

403,"The Easy Walk Harness is 100% worth the money. Especially if its bought on here.... We have a 2 1/2 yr old Bichon weighing 15lbs. As a puppy we took him to obedience classes where we would learn to walk on the leash. The trainer worked very hard with us but we had no success. So needless to say we did not go on too many walks. Not only was is embarrassing to have this little 15lb dog dominating both his owners... but it literally felt like he was going to rip our arms off.I bought this harness and there was an immediate difference. He would still try and pull but the harness would make his legs go inward a little so he wouldn't be able to any more. We have never, ever been able to enjoy going on walks. Now, our dog stops to smell the roses - literally! I was worried that it would ruin his spirit, not being allowed be as excited as he wanted. But I think it has only helped! He has some pep in his step and prances and wags his tail...instead of ripping our arms off and pulling so hard he chokes himself and gets sick! This item is a MUST! Can not rate it high enough!",dogs
404,"I bought the Mr. Bill doll on a whim one day, and it turned out to be a great decision. I got the doll for my one year old, eighteen-pound dachshund/terrier mix. She absolutely LOVES her Mr. Bill. And my whole family cracked up when they saw her playing with him. Every time she bites him and he says his famous line, she stops dead in her tracks, drops him and tilts her head sidways just STARING in confusion. As soon as the ""Oh, Nooooo!"" is over she goes right back tossing and tugging. He is easily her favorite toy and she even carries him to bed.Another thing I like about the toy is that besides the funny factor, it is quite sturdy for a plush toy. The seams appear to be sewn VERY well. Even after many sessions of vigorous rough tugging, our Mr. Bill has only suffered a few minor ""injuries"". The tears are easily fixed with a quick bit of hand stitching. (The biggest rip actually came from my weimaraner/labrador mix who, unfortunately, has a penchant for de-stuffing all things fluffy!)Now about the voicebox. The voicebox is the only real concern one could have with the toy. However, with proper judgement and a little common-sense you can decide whether or not this toy is right for your pet. If u have a dog that is an aggressive chewer of toys and/or is prone to swollowing non-food objects then I suggest you pass this toy over. Also I do not recommend this toy for most big dogs because, normally wih big dogs come more powerful jaws. And strong bites can crush the battery powered voicebox inside. This toy should also be used under supervision to avoid accidents.Overall though, I do recommend this funny little toy, as he has become a treasured member of my doggie's toy collection. As a matter-of-fact she is cuddling with him right now on the couch asleep. :)",dogs

I purchased a 5 pack in late May that only lasted about 1.5 months. Not sure whether other consumers have noticed the same thing? I contacted PetMate but was informed that they no longer manufacture the refills. I think the refills are now manufactured in Canada.

I found some for 200 dollars and that was way to expensive. But then I found this on amazon and it was perfect it was cheap. I put two drops behind each ear and rubbed it into the skin. I even put it on my other guinea pig just so she didnt get the mites as well. Within a week S'mores got better she cheered up and the patches cleared up. Her hair even grew back.

427,I can not recommend this product. It works well as far as the flow of water is concerned although the capacity is not enough for multiple cats.My complaint with this product is that it leaks. When I first received the unit I would notice small amounts of water around the dish and assumed it was from my cats drinking. After having this product for several months I discovered this was not the case. It appears that the stainless steel water ramp is inserted into the plastic via tiny holes and this is where the leaking occurs. The puddle around the unit became so large that I had to buy a mat and fill the unit almost daily because the water would run out.This weekend I tossed the item to the trash and purchased the Drinkwell Platinum. It is one solid piece of plastic so it can not leak. Overall the construction just seems to be a lot better. It also holds a generous amount of water for my 3 cats.,cats

431,"Every year at the vet office, we would be told that one of our cats had a problem with dental plaque. After going through the trouble to have her teeth cleaned, we figured these would be worth a try even though they are expensive. The cats love them! The only problem is that they are too big for either cat to eat so I cut them in half. The treats have an outer casing though, which is important in helping clean the teeth and is unfortunately very fragile and likely to tear. To slice the treats, I very carefully poke through the casing and the treat all the way around with a knife until it comes apart - a regular slicing motion would tear the casing and reduce the effectiveness of the treat. This is quite time consuming when I open a new package (I split all 50 treats at once to make dispensing easier later), but we have been plaque-free and the cats are happy!",cats

435,"MY cat urinated in the back seat of my car on the way to the vet, and I stupidly waited a day to clean it out, because I thought it would just evaporate. Well, it did evaporate, but the stink remained.My sister told me about Anti-Icky-Poo (she's a vet), but I didn't want to spend the money (it seemed pricey, and I couldn't get anything less than a quart, which is more than I needed). I thought I could take care of it with vinegar, baking soda, carpet cleaner, and a wet vacuum. It seemed fine for a few days, but the stink returned. Then I tried a pet odor remover from my local store (which cost about $7), and then OdoBan($4-5) - both seemed to initially work when I sprayed them on, but after they dried, the odor returned. The OdoBan worked fairly well, but there was still a slight stink, especially if the car is closed up tight.I finally caved, after 4 weeks, when I came home to my car that was parked for 3 days at the airport, and was greeted by overwhelming cat urine smell. As soon as I got the Anti-Icky-Poo, I sprayed it on my car seat before I went to sleep. To my amazement, the next day when I entered the car, there was absolutely NO smell of cat urine. I went to work, and at the end of the day, the car was still fresh. I re-applied it once more on sections of the cushion I missed (I had to do a really close sniff test to detect any remaining odor), and sure enough, the smell is gone almost instantly.I am really happy with the product, and I recommend it.

439,"This is not a miracle worker - algae is still present. It still has to be cleaned out of the pond and the filter (which in my case is a 30-gallon pond). It will still clog the filter covering the pump motor. However, none of the above has to be done NEARLY as often as it did before we discovered this wonderful product. I use it fairly frequently, more in hot weather and it gets HOT here. I haven't tried any other products, and I don't see any reason to do so. Read the directions 3 or 4 times before using and I think you'll be glad you bought it.",fish aquatic pets
440,"We are a one cat household so I'm not sure how well this will work in multi-cat homes but for us this is wonderful. We converted when we were living in a very small studio and the litter odor was killing us. We have an elderly cat so she urinates a little more than normal and the smell was killing us no matter how many times we cleaned. We slowly weaned her off of the clay litter and onto this and we've never looked back. There is *no* odor to speak of and it is so clean and sanitary compared to that awful clay litter. My cat doesn't have it all over her paws and ingesting it and she seems to have taken to it well also. The only negative and it just might be my cat is that she drags the pellets out with her and they get on the bathroom floor, but I'd rather clean those up than clay!",cats
441,"This toy is cute. I like it, but my dog doesn't. He doesn't play rough with his toys, so this would be fine for him if he liked it. Because of the voicebox, I wouldn't suggest buying it for any dog that is likely to tear it apart.",dogs

443,"Bought two of these for two mid-size terrier mixes. They had a tendency to bark whenever our 1 year old son was napping or whenever we were not home to discipline them. The neighbor's dogs bark at anything within 1/2 mile of the house, and that puts our dogs on guard.Nevertheless, I put it on one dog. She barked. It sprayed. She stopped. So did the other dog, even though she wasn't wearing hers. They seemed to think that the spray was coming from the gate and not her collar. It definitely takes their attention away from what is making them bark. Point is that they did attribute it to their barking, and both dogs, after having used the collars a handful of times, stopped barking. Without the collars on, they do still bark, but I have to admit that it is less. Now if I can only get my neighbors to use them.I recommend saving your money on the refills until you find you need them (unless it makes mores sense on shipping costs).",dogs
444,"Two years ago my mother's dog pulled her off her feet, breaking her nose and dislocating her shoulder in the process. She's in her 50's and hasn't been able to walk him on a leash since. I purchased the Gentle Leader as a last resort to try to get them to walk together once more. All of her children are grown and she lives alone with her dog, so not being able to do this simple task broke her heart. Today they took their first walk around the block in two years. It took roughly 20 minutes to desensitize the dog enough to put the device on his head, but not long before his natural instincts kicked in and he relaxed enough to be walked. I highly recommend this product to anyone with the time to spend properly training the dog on this style lead. Thank you for giving my mom her morning walks with her favorite four legged child again.",dogs

458,"After much research on a kitty perch, I found this product had mostly good reviews. The complaints were that unless you screw this perch into the window sill and use just the velcro, it is not very sturdy. I'd have to agree with this. I didn't even bother velcro this to the window sill because just by looking at the perch and the fact my cat is 10lbs and jumps from the floor or the couch, I knew this perch would rip right off the window sill. I didn't want to put my cat in that situation so I just went ahead and screwed it to the sill. I know this might not be feasible for many, but I live in an apartment complex and they said holes were fine so I did it.That being said, when it is drilled into the sill, it's very sturdy. I guess my window sill is pretty far up because I realized the cat couldn't really jump to the perch from the floor, so I moved a piece of cat furntiure close to the perch so he could climb up. I was hesistant to buy this after also reading about needing super human strength to ""snap"" on the legs. First off, I'm pretty certain these legs do not add any value aside aesthics because I do not think they actually aid in the support of the perch. That being said, I was very confused when I opened the box and saw the holes to put the legs in were too large and had no idea how I was supposed to ""snap"" these legs into place. After a short struggle and frustration, I read a review saying there are small notches that it should fit into. After some researched, I found to ""snap"" the legs into place, its as easy as using a hammer! Just tap the legs into place with a hammer and they will become secure.My cat isn't using the perch yet (at least not when I'm home) but I believe once he trusts it more, he will. I'd say unless you are screwing this into your window sill, I'd find a more secure method than the velcro stickers they include!",cats

A few months ago I had bought a similar cat toy to these (a plastic circle that's easily batted around on hardwood floors and able to able to be picked up in the mouth) and they liked that a lot more.

Former methods of using a choke collar or even worse a harsh coller that will cut into the dogs neck if it pulls are cruel in my opinion as is the method of jerking the dog back if it pulls. Dogs do not like to have thier heads turned if they pull. They will IMMEDIATELY stop pulling! I admit that initially my dogs didn't like the collar over the nose, but that passes quickly. This is not a muzzle in any way. It gently and humanely stops the tugging and you will have happy walks! This product is a blessing! You will love it.",dogs

466,I was hesitant to try this product for fear of my puppy becoming dependent on it. However I bought a possessed beagle puppy that would howl whenever she was alone....even if for only a minute. Her howling became so bad that my neighbors were calling the police. I went so far to call a dog behavioralist who told me to return her to the breeder. I bought this as a last resort and am amazed at the transformation. She is now the quietest and sweetest puppy ever! I can definitely tell when we are running low though as she starts whining again. I will always keep this around. It has saved my sanity.,dogs

But, something about it makes my cat go nuts on it more so than any other toy I've got her.

I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad from the curing chemicals but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides.

473,"I have two small Labradors, and in less than three hours they had torn a basketball-sized hole through the chainlink right in the middle of the kennel. The fence itself is cheap, flimsy and loosily woven; it flexes way more than it should and I had my doubts about it being secure before I started construction. I repaired the hole in the chainlink by reweaving the wire and reinforcing it with the bendable metal fastners that come with the build but it was only another hour or so of them left alone before they had yet another hole torn. This isnt't from bending up from the bottom or pealing a piece back thats unsecure; this is the middle of the fence and the metal is being unwoven and stretched. All in all, I've mad four repairs, and there's been 5 holes ann in different locations. The last one is the deal breaker, the kennel is ruined, and it never not even once provided more than a few hours of an enclosure for my dogs. I would not recommend this product to anyone; it's expensive, low quality and unreliable. Maybe if you have little toy dogs with half-a-brain that wouldn't dare to put force on the fence, then you *might* be alright so long as they never test their boundries, but Labradors want out and this will not keep them from achieving that. Do not buy this sorry excuse for a kennel.",dogs

475,"Angel's Eyes is truly an answer to my prayer. My beautiful little dog always had these ugly brown stains running down from his eyes. I had tried everything. It was so frustrating. Then I saw an ad for Angel's Eyes and ordered it from Amazon when I saw the before and after pictures of dogs who had used it. It is a powder and the first challenge is getting your dog to eat the product. I sprinkled it over his food and he stopped eating the food. I tried everything to get this nasty powder down his throat. Finally I realized how much the dog liked milk. So I stirred it in with milk, added some vanilla pudding for a sweetner and then some Fiber 1 cereal with honey clusters. Well....the dog gobbled it up and begged for more. That works for us. So he now has a lunchtime treat of Angel Eyes and the ""happy mixture"" and we have a miracle. It has been a month now and his eyes are absolutely beautiful. The stains are gone. This is a mild antibiotic and ground liver. I talked to my vet before using the product and although it is an antibiotic, he said it was very mild and would seldom be used to treat any problem that a dog would have. The vet made our little Sam his ""experiment dog"" taking before and after pictures. And it is amazing how beautiful his eyes are now. Although some dogs will eat this on their food, the main thing is to have patience and find what works for you in getting the dog to eat this product. I am delighted with the results. People used to look at my dog and say, ""What's wrong with his eyes."" Now they say, ""What a beautiful little dog."" I am so grateful for Angel's Eyes. You will need to keep giving the product to the dog on a regular basis. For the first three months every day, and then about three times a week. It is expensive, but it is worth it as far as I am concerned to have the ugly eye stains gone. I recommend this product highly.",dogs

I highly recommend that you use a premium super clumping litter, though, because if the clumps break apart they don't get scooped out of the box.

Most reviewers claim it flies well, so maybe it's me, but I have other discs that I can send really well and far (Jawz disc is best).

494,"My vet (at a world famous vet hospital in the Boston area) said greenies were ok. Here's the basic deal- There are incidents of dogs choking and dying over greenies, rawhide, natural bones, rubber balls, toys ... just about everything- Greenies gets a lot of press because it's an established company - there's someone for mourning owners to blame and sue - but that's the only reason greenies gets singled out. We love our dogs, of course, and it just takes one or two people to tell the world their heart wrenching stories, and then you think it's an epedemic.- overall the risks are very very very low. It's a handful of cases over millions and millions of dogs. And the risk of rawhide is not lower than greenies.- Moreso, dogs need to chew on something like rawhide or greenies. Tooth health is also critical to dog health. Dogs die early due to poor nutrition if their teeth decay too young. And that's what will happen if you don't give your dog chewable treats like greenies or rawhide or natural bone - their teeth will decay and fall out before their time.So overall, your dog needs bones/chews for long term health. The risk of greenies is the same as the risk of rawhide and is less than 1 in 100,000 or anything close to that. But the risk your dog faces if you deny her/him things like this are much higher because they need it for tooth health.",dogs
495,"The Midwest Quiet Time Bolster Pet Bed Fleece is a useful pet product from Midwest Homes for Pets. It is one of multiple different dog beds sold by this manufacture but among them, this one ranks as the most practical. Its design is soft, it is machine washable, and it is easy to roll up and store.This dog bed has been part of my household for less than a year, but it is already a huge hit with my west highland white terrier. My dog isn't permitted on the furniture or beds due to his bad habits, so I decided one day to purchase him a dog bed so that he wouldn't be forced to sleep on the hard tile floor. He took a quick liking to the bed thanks to its softness and he has been enjoying his sleep better and staying asleep longer than he was before.Dogs can have accidents and mine is prone to them, so I knew it was only a matter of time until he had his first accident on or near this bed. Now, with some other dog beds, it would be very difficult to get the bedding completely clean, but it is easy with this dog bed because it is machine washable. You just place it directly in the washer, then transfer it directly to the dryer. It comes out clean and soft, ready to use again.Midwest Quiet Time Bolster Pet Bed Fleece has proven itself a very good addition to my dog's sleeping habits, but this isn't the perfect product. First, the base cushioning isn't very thick and you may need to place a folded up blanket underneath to get a more ideal level of cushioning. Another problem I have relates to washing. I am very thankful that this dog bed is machine washable, but if it gets washed too much, it slowly starts to fall apart, as I have experienced. So, if you buy this dog bed and find yourself washing it frequently, I recommend using the most gentle cycle possible, in order to keep the bed in one piece.Dogs deserve a soft place to sleep and the Midwest Quiet Time Bolster Pet Bed Fleece provides exactly that. It does have a few small issues, but it is still usable and my dog loves the comfort it provides.",dogs

He would have choked on it if I hadn't quickly taken it out of his mouth. I threw the rest of the package away.I thought these were chew toys and they dissolved like rawhide (or not at all).
